# Assignment for Class

## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a developer, I want to use basic markup to structure my index.html page, so the layout is in the order of assembly I prefer
 - As a developer, I want to receive and use the user's name, so that the program is personalized to their experience.

## Technical Requirements
 - Work will be done in an HTML file in Atom, and then submitted via Canvas (copy and paste into submission)
 - Good use of HTML; e.g. 'body', 'doctype', 'p', 'head', 'html', 'h1', and 'title'
 - HTML is cleanly written and indented for readability and organization
 - JavaScript written to alert the user in a "Hello, World" type of script
