#Supporting Information
###Move logic into functions:
As we demonstrated in class today, move the logic for the individual questions into separate functions, and call those functions to initiate the game. Use the code from class today as a model. After completing this step the game should behave exactly as it did before. **a-c-p**

###Move the alerts into the browser window:
Using the code from class today (`document.getElementById()`) as a model, move the alert feedback to the game player into `<p>`  or `<h2>` tags or similar that display in the browser window. **a-c-p**

###Update the README file:
Always take a look at your README file and see if it needs updating based upon your most recent work.

###Code style:
As always, strive for readable and maintainable code. Fix any issues with indenting and other code style, such as improving variable names and ensuring that line terminations are done properly. **a-c-p**
