# Assignment for Class
Today we will be expanding our javascript to include functions so that we can execute code blocks more logically, and later on, in a more controlled manner.

## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a developer, I want my code written in a modular way, so that I can reuse functionality without duplicating code.
 - As a developer, I want my user to see the answers and responses on the web page, so we do not have to constantly interact with alerts.

## Technical Requirements
 - Updated and cleanly documented README
 - Game functionality is encapsulated in functions
 - Alerts have been removed from the game, and replaced by printing answers to the DOM.

## User Stories (Stretch)
- As a developer, I want to add a sixth question to my game, which has multiple possible answers (hint: using an array and for loop)
- As a developer, I want to add some basic styling to my site, so that I can increase the happiness and engagement of my users (hint: do not use inline styling for this; you should link to another file for your styling)
