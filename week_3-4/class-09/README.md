## User Stories (MVP)
 - (Pair programming) As a developer, I want to implement a form on the website so Pat has the ability to enter new stores without a developer to help him
 - (Individual) As a developer, I want to implement event management on my page, so that my form will listen and react to click events

## Technical Requirements
 - Form properly implemented in the html
 - Events have been wired up and are rendering new store data to the page

## User Stories (Stretch)
 - As a user, I want to be able to update data that is already available on the page, so that I do not have to have the developer manually remove and rewrite data.
